🌾 Agri_dashboard Analytics Dashboard
📊 Power BI Interactive Report — Agricultural Insights for Karnataka State
This repository contains a Power BI dashboard that analyzes Karnataka’s agricultural performance, focusing on crop yields, cultivation area, market prices, rainfall, and irrigation methods.
The dashboard enables data-driven agricultural planning by visualizing patterns across seasons, crop types, and locations.

📌 1. Dashboard Highlights
Metric	Value	Description
💰 Total Price Value	16M	Combined market value of all yields
🌾 Yield Count	186	Total number of recorded yield entries
📐 Max Area	52K	Largest cultivation area recorded

Filters Available

Crop Seasons: Kharif | Rabi | Zaid

Irrigation Types: Basin | Drip | Spray

📌 2. Key Visuals & Insights
A. Geographical Yield Distribution (Map View)
Largest yields concentrated in Mysuru, Hassan, and Madikeri.

Northern Karnataka districts such as Raichur have lower yields.

B. Cultivation Area by Location
Top 3 cultivated areas:

Mysuru – Highest cultivation footprint

Hassan

Madikeri

Minimal cultivation in Raichur and Gulbarga.

C. Revenue Contribution by Crop (Treemap)
Ginger → Highest revenue contributor

Coconut & Arecanut → Major contributors

Other crops: Tea, Pepper (smaller share)

D. Top Yield Locations (Horizontal Bar Chart)
Rank	Location	Yield Value (M)
1️⃣	Mysuru	1.53M
2️⃣	Hassan	1.21M
3️⃣	Madikeri	0.30M
4️⃣	Gulbarga	0.30M
5️⃣	Kodagu	0.17M
6️⃣	Raichur	0.02M

E. Price & Rainfall Trends by Location (Line Charts)
Hassan leads in both market price and rainfall.

Declining trend in both metrics from Hassan → Raichur.

📌 3. Data-Driven Observations
Yield & Price Link — Districts with larger cultivation areas and rainfall (e.g., Hassan, Mysuru) have higher yield values.

Crop Dependency — A few crops dominate revenue, which poses a risk to stability.

Rainfall Gap — Low-rainfall regions like Raichur need irrigation infrastructure improvements.

Regional Disparity — Northern districts underperform compared to the south.

📌 4. Recommendations
✅ Expand drip & spray irrigation in low-rainfall districts.
✅ Promote crop diversification beyond Ginger & Coconut.
✅ Implement season-specific crop rotation plans to optimize yields in Rabi and Zaid.
✅ Support farmers in low-yield zones with subsidized inputs and market linkages.
