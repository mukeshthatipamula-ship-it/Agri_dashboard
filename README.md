Geographical Distribution: Multiple Karnataka districts

Crops: Ginger, Coconut, Arecanut, Pepper, Tea, etc.

2. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Sum of Price: 16M â€“ Total market price value of yields.

Count of Yields: 186 â€“ Total recorded yield instances.

Max of Area: 52K â€“ Largest cultivation area recorded.

3. Insights from Visuals
A. Sum of Yields by Location (Map View)
The bubble map highlights yield volumes by district.

Larger circles indicate higher yields.

Top locations: Mysuru, Hassan, and Madikeri.

B. Sum of Area by Location
Mysuru has the largest cultivated area, followed by Hassan and Madikeri.

Smaller areas in Raichur and Gulbarga.

C. Sum of Price by Crops (Tree Map)
Top revenue crops:

Ginger â€“ Leading in price contribution.

Coconut â€“ Second-highest contributor.

Arecanut â€“ Significant share.

Smaller revenue shares from Tea, Pepper, and other crops.

D. Top Yield Locations in Karnataka
Mysuru leads with 1.53M yield value.

Hassan follows with 1.21M.

Madikeri and Gulbarga are in the mid-range (~0.3M each).

Kodagu and Raichur show minimal yields.

E. Sum of Price by Location (Line Area Chart)
Hassan tops in pricing, followed by Mysuru.

Declining trend from Madikeri â†’ Gulbarga â†’ Kodagu â†’ Raichur.

F. Sum of Rainfall by Location
Hassan records the highest rainfall among shown locations.

Rainfall declines across Madikeri, Mysuru, Gulbarga, Kodagu, and Raichur.

4. Observations & Analysis
Yield & Pricing: Thereâ€™s a strong correlation between cultivated area and yield value, with Mysuru and Hassan being prime contributors.

Crop Diversity: Revenue is concentrated among a few crops (Ginger, Coconut, Arecanut).

Rainfall Impact: Locations with higher rainfall tend to have better yield and price performance.

Geographical Disparity: Northern Karnataka districts like Raichur have significantly lower yields and rainfall.

5. Possible Actions / Recommendations
Invest in irrigation infrastructure in low-rainfall areas (e.g., Raichur, Kodagu) to boost yield.

Diversify crop cultivation to reduce dependency on a few high-value crops.

Implement seasonal strategies tailored for Kharif, Rabi, and Zaid periods.
